1(iii) Adonai said to Moshe and Aharon, 2“The people of Isra’el are to set up camp by clans, each man with his own banner and under his clan’s symbol; they are to camp around the tent of meeting, but at a distance.
3-9“Those camping on the east side toward the sunrise are to be under the banner of the camp of Y’hudah; they are to camp according to companies; by tribe and leader they are as follows:
“This group is to set out first.
10-16“Those camping on the south are to be under the banner of the camp of Re’uven; they are to camp according to companies; by tribe and leader they are as follows:
“This group is to set out second.
17“Then the tent of meeting, with the camp of the L’vi’im, will set out, with the other camps in front and behind. They will go in the same order as their camps are set up — each man will go forward in his position, under his banner.
18-24“Those camping on the west are to be under the banner of the camp of Efrayim; they are to camp according to companies; by tribe and leader they are as follows:
“This group is to set out third.
25-31“Those camping on the north are to be under the banner of the camp of Dan; they are to camp according to companies; by tribe and leader they are as follows:
“This group is to set out last with their banners.”
32These are the ones counted from the people of Isra’el by clans; the total number recorded in the camps, company by company, was 603,550. 33But, as Adonai ordered Moshe, the L’vi’im were not counted with the rest of Isra’el.
34The people of Isra’el did everything Adonai had ordered Moshe: they set up camp under their banners, and they set out, each according to his family and clan.
