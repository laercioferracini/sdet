1(vii) Moshe ascended from the plains of Mo’av to Mount N’vo, to the summit of Pisgah, across from Yericho. There Adonai showed him all the land — Gil‘ad as far as Dan, 2all Naftali, the land of Efrayim and M’nasheh, the land of Y’hudah all the way to the sea beyond, 3the Negev, and the ‘Aravah, including the valley where Yericho, the City of Date-Palms, as far away as Tzo‘ar. 4Adonai said to him, “This is the land concerning which I swore to Avraham, Yitz’chak and Ya‘akov, ‘I will give it to your descendants.’ I have let you see it with your eyes, but you will not cross over there.”
5So Moshe, the servant of Adonai, died there in the land of Mo’av, as Adonai had said. 6He was buried in the valley across from Beit-P‘or in the land of Mo’av, but to this day no one knows where his grave is.
7Moshe was 120 years old when he died, with eyes undimmed and vigor undiminished. 8The people of Isra’el mourned Moshe on the plains of Mo’av for thirty days; after this, the days of crying and mourning for Moshe ended.
9Y’hoshua the son of Nun was full of the Spirit of wisdom, for Moshe had laid his hands on him, and the people of Isra’el heeded him and did what Adonai had ordered Moshe.
10Since that time there has not arisen in Isra’el a prophet like Moshe, whom Adonai knew face to face. 11What signs and wonders Adonai sent him to perform in the land of Egypt upon Pharaoh, all his servants and all his land! 12What might was in his hand! What great terror he evoked before the eyes of all Isra’el!
